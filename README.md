# PythonRiotAnalysis
This is meant to be a fun dataset to explore or a fun project to build and learn off of! Great basic web automation, API call, and Image introduction!

Uses [FacesOfTheRiot](https://facesoftheriot.com/) (https://facesoftheriot.com/) and Python to explore the emotion -- and some other aspects -- of the United States Capital Rioters using Selenium as well as the Azure Face API. Includes a JSON with the Azure analysis data in case anyone wants to analyze it more than I have the time for! 

Again, the data is *not* accurate by any means and is not meant to draw any real conclusions from. The images (for the most part) are not low-res and are being fed to an AI.
